Hi! I'm Joao, a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization](https://www.ds.mpg.de/en) under Dr. [Viola Priesemann](http://www.viola-priesemann.de). My current research topic is the large-scale dynamical behavior of brain networks, and how to sample it. I'm also interested in [photography](https://www.instagram.com/joao.p.n/).
