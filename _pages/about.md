Hi! I'm a physicist currently working on collective dynamics in complex networks. I focus on understanding how the dynamics and topology of social networks impact opinion spreading in social media. I'm particularly interested in how network dynamics can help understand and ultimately counteract the spreading of fake news. I also have experience with the use of non-equilibrium phase transitions to model how activity spreads in the brain.
