Hi! I'm a physicist working on computational social science. I focus on comparing different social media platforms, trying to understand what makes them tick. I believe that data-driven toy models can help design social media platforms that are better and more resilient to manipulation by bad actors. I also believe that timely work can influence decision-making and ultimately pressure platforms into design decisions that do more than blindingly chase engagement metrics.
