Hi! I'm a physicist with experience in computational social science. I focus on comparing different social media platforms, trying to understand what makes them tick. I believe that data-driven toy models can help design social media platforms that are better, and more resilient to manipulation by bad actors. I also believe that timely research can influence decision-making and ultimately pressure platforms into design decisions that do more than blindingly chase engagement metrics.
<br />
<br />
My approach involves large-scale data collection, as well as analysis and modeling using techniques from physics, statistics, and machine learning.  In particular, I currently focus on large language models as both object of research (their impact on social media) and as tools for simulating and analyzing social media content.
