12/23/2017	Inhibition as a determinant of activity and criticality in dynamical networks	arxiv	"A certain degree of inhibition is a common trait of dynamical networks in nature, ranging from neuronal and biochemical networks, to social and technological networks. We study here the role of inhibition in a representative dynamical network model, characterizing the dynamics of random threshold networks with both excitatory and inhibitory links. Varying the fraction of excitatory links has a strong effect on the network's population activity and its sensitivity to perturbation. The average degree $K$, known to have a strong effect on the dynamics when small, loses its influence on the dynamics as its value increases. Instead, the strength of inhibition is a determinant of dynamics and sensitivity here, allowing for criticality only in a specific corridor of inhibition. This criticality corridor requires that excitation dominates, while the balance region corresponds to maximum sensitivity to perturbation. We develop mean-field approximations of the population activity and sensitivity and find that the network dynamics is independent of degree distribution for high $K$. In a minimal model of an adaptive threshold network we demonstrate how the dynamics remains robust against changes in the topology. This adaptive model can be extended in order to generate networks with a controllable activity distribution and specific topologies."	"Pinheiro Neto, J., de Aguiar, M. A. M., Brum, J.

6/11/2018	Operating in a Reverberating Regime Enables Rapid Tuning of Network States to Task Requirements	Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience	"Neural circuits are able to perform computations under very diverse conditions and requirements. The required computations impose clear constraints on their fine-tuning: a rapid and maximally informative response to stimuli in general requires decorrelated baseline neural activity. Such network dynamics is known as asynchronous-irregular. In contrast, spatio-temporal integration of information requires maintenance and transfer of stimulus information over extended time periods. This can be realized at criticality, a phase transition where correlations, sensitivity and integration time diverge. Being able to flexibly switch, or even combine the above properties in a task-dependent manner would present a clear functional advantage. We propose that cortex operates in a “reverberating regime” because it is particularly favorable for ready adaptation of computational properties to context and task. This reverberating regime enables cortical networks to interpolate between the asynchronous-irregular and the critical state by small changes in effective synaptic strength or excitation-inhibition ratio. These changes directly adapt computational properties, including sensitivity, amplification, integration time and correlation length within the local network. We review recent converging evidence that cortex in vivo operates in the reverberating regime, and that various cortical areas have adapted their integration times to processing requirements. In addition, we propose that neuromodulation enables a fine-tuning of the network, so that local circuits can either decorrelate or integrate, and quench or maintain their input depending on task. We argue that this task-dependent tuning, which we call “dynamic adaptive computation,” presents a central organization principle of cortical networks and discuss first experimental evidence."
