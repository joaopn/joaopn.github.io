Inhibition is an important factor in many networks. Particularly, inhibitory synapses play a large role in regulating neuronal activity in the brain.  Beyond modulating firing rates, it can suppress pathways and influence large-scale dynamical properties of the brain.  This project aims to understand how varying degrees of inhibition can influence dynamical properties such as phase transitions and attractors in neural networks.
