In large networks, it is typically not possible to measure activity from the full system. One must then sample a reduced number of units (*subsampling*) or an average of a large number (*coarse sampling*). Depending on the system, this can bias our assessment of the system properties. This project aims to understand how coarse sampling techniques, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP), can bias our assessment of the dynamics of neural networks both *in vivo* and *in vitro*.
